            High Quality Translations
        </h2>
        <p>
            It's imperative a translator respects the voice of the original material while adapting the text into something that reads natural, as if a native speaker had written it. This
            is something at which I excel. Not only am I a native Spanish speaker and writer, but I am also a natural English speaker and writer. In fact, I do what few translators must. I
            write and speak both languages every single day and have for years. This extends me the unique ability to grasp the linguistic and extra-linguistic characteristics of each. I
            offer direct and reverse translations.

            Direct Translation
        </h3>
        <p>
            A direct translation is where a translator takes a work in a foreign language and puts it into their native language. This is the simplest type of translation and what most translators do.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-responsive mt-4">
            Reverse Translation
        </h3>
        <p>
            A reverse translation is where the translator takes a work from their native language and puts it into a foreign language. Few translators can manage reverse translations because of the idiomatic demand reverse translations place on them.
